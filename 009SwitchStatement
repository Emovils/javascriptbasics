// switch statement is a control flow statement that allows executiion of one block of code among mutiple alternatives
// it allows variables to be tested fot equalities among a list of values 


let day = "Monday" 
    // the code below contains daily schedule for the week using switch statement
    // Note: once you match the case it will print everything from the matched case downwards. so  in order to avoid it you use breaks inbetween
switch(day){
// in switch yo have to pass a variable which is day 
      case 'Monday':
          console.log("7am");
          break;
          // break means jump out of the block
      case "Tuesday":
      case "Wednsday":
      case "Thursday":
           console.log("9am");
           break;
// Another way to use break is to Merge the items together like the one Above
     case "Friday":
          console.log("7am");
          break;
     case "Saturday":
          console.log("9am");
          break;
     case "Sunday":
          console.log("6:30am");
    case "Holiday":
         console.log("study time");
         break;
        
}
console.log("lets have fun");
